# Game-

As a way to help practice object-oriented programming, I'm trying my hand at writing a text-based game in Java and C++

####"Java game" (Java)

Progress:

- Started implementing the satchel and inventory in "Java game"

####"Game!" (C++)

Progress:

- You are greeted by a welcome message and can enter your name! ...That's about it for now.
